# SOLUTION.md

## Task Summary
The task involved debugging and enhancing a server to meet the following objectives:
1. Debug and fix the existing server code.
2. Transition the server from single-threaded to multithreaded.
3. Enable the server to handle multiple clients concurrently while maintaining data consistency.
4. Extend the test suite to validate the enhanced functionality.

## Key Differences and Solutions

### 1. Debugging and Fixing the Server Code

#### Issues in Old Code:
- **Single-threaded server design**:
  - The server handled one client at a time, which blocked other clients from connecting.
  - The `run` method loop blocked the execution until the current client's interaction was completed.
- **Inefficient error handling**:
  - Missing or minimal handling for non-blocking operations and connection errors.
  - The `handle` method for `Client` didn't check `WouldBlock` errors, causing potential freezes.
- **Improper `EchoMessage` handling**:
  - Only `EchoMessage` was supported. Additional request types like `AddRequest` were missing.
- **Data decoding and encoding issues**:
  - Errors in handling partially read or malformed messages led to server crashes.

#### Fixes in New Code:
- **Refactored server loop**:
  - Introduced non-blocking I/O using `set_nonblocking(true)` for the server socket and client streams.
  - Added retry mechanisms and efficient sleeping (`Duration::from_millis`) to reduce CPU usage.
- **Multithreading support**:
  - Used `std::thread` to spawn a dedicated thread for each connected client.
  - Leveraged `Arc<AtomicBool>` to manage the server's running state across threads.
- **Improved client handling**:
  - Checked for `WouldBlock` errors in the client handler loop to avoid deadlocks.
  - Implemented a mechanism to flush responses explicitly to ensure data consistency.
- **Enhanced protocol support**:
  - Added support for multiple message types, including `AddRequest` and `EchoMessage`.
  - Ensured consistent encoding/decoding using `prost`.

### 2. Transitioning to a Multithreaded Server

#### Old Code:
- The server handled all clients in a single thread.
- Any blocking operation, such as a `read` or `write`, halted the entire server.

#### New Code:
- Each client connection is managed in a separate thread (`std::thread::spawn`).
- The `Arc<AtomicBool>` flag ensures all threads can gracefully terminate when the server stops.
- Mutex-protected shared resources (`Arc<Mutex<Vec<TcpStream>>>`) maintain data consistency.

---

### 3. Enhancing Client Functionality

#### Client Connection Management:
- **Old Code**:
  - Basic connect and disconnect functionality.
  - Errors on missing or invalid addresses weren't handled gracefully.
- **New Code**:
  - Enhanced `connect` method with address validation using `to_socket_addrs`.
  - Added explicit `disconnect` functionality that safely shuts down the TCP stream.

#### Message Communication:
- **Old Code**:
  - Only supported `EchoMessage` with basic decoding and echoing back.
- **New Code**:
  - Implemented a generic `send` method to handle multiple message types.
  - Added `receive` method with detailed error handling for decoding failures.

### 4. Extending the Test Suite

#### Improvements:
1. **Multiclient Tests**:
   - Added a `test_multiple_clients` case to simulate concurrent client connections.
   - Validated message consistency for each client.
2. **New Request Types**:
   - Enhanced test cases for `AddRequest` to verify correct computation.
3. **Timeout Management**:
   - Introduced timeouts to detect hanging tests (e.g., 30 seconds limit for `test_multiple_clients`).

---

### 5. Performance Improvements
- Introduced non-blocking I/O for both server and client operations.
- Reduced CPU usage during idle periods with efficient sleep intervals.
- Streamlined the message processing loop to minimize delays for other clients.
